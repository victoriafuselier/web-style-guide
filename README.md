 Treehouse Project 4: Web Style Guide

The purpose of this project was to build a useful Sass micro-framework to quickly prototype other websites. The project starter files provided completed index.css and styles.css files. I was responsible for converting CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. I was also instructed to look for repeated values throughout the CSS and store them in reusable Sass variables. This also built on my existing CSS skills.

The basic requirements of this project included: properly structuring my folders; creating proper file structure; setting up Sass to watch for changes--I gained familiarity with the Scout App during this time; adding styles to the typography partial; moving styles in components partial.

The extra credit requirements of this project included: using a nested selector structure for at least one component by creating a base selector group of related styles then using the Sass parent selector '&' to append a child class selector to the base; using a built in Sass function to add a hover effect to buttons that lightened button background color and added a CSS transition so that the color change fades in.

I went beyond the requirements listed above by: adding more than the required 4 component partials; using a nested selector more than once; using a mobile-first approach to make this site look great at all screen widths from 320px, 768px, 1024px, and wider.
